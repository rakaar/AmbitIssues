**Trillbit: Internet of Sound**

**&quot;The internet of sound&quot; aims to bring sound to the technological revolution it has missed. It aims to give the unexplored power of sound back to people. Universal nature of sound makes it very powerful and offers a unique platform for people and businesses to connect.**

_&quot;There are more number of audio speakers than people. Trillbit can connect them all to build the &#39;Internet of Sound&#39;._

Sight and sound are central to how we perceive the world. These are so intertwined with the human condition that it is almost a tactile part of humanity itself. Humanity is often defined by of our culture and art and here too music and visual art have dominated our expression.

However in the technological revolution of the later part of 20th century, sight has simply overtaken and overwhelmed our imagination. First it was color screens , then touch screens , 3D and now augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR), the progress has been staggering. Earlier artistic expression required a medium and technology served an intermediary and an enabler. However the recent technological pace has completely shifted the paradigm. Now mediums such as AR and VR are looking for artists and creatives to server the platform.

Somehow sound has missed this popular revolution.

Sure enough, there has been incremental development in sound technology , especially in music delivery technology but apart from Bose&#39;s noise cancelling headphone technology from late 1980&#39;s and early 1990&#39;s , there has been no game changing advancement. Sound is ubiquitous, it reaches where sight cannot, we are surrounded by it , it touches our hearts , it&#39;s our primary mode of communication and connection with the world and yet its possibilities have remained unexplored. Oil &amp; gas Industry and military have not missed the train though. They have understood and exploited sound to do amazing things. Oil industry can build detail 3D images of earth tens of kms deep without a single drill by just using sound. This is akin to taking a 3D picture of a dark room while standing 3 buildings away. Researchers in the medical industry are are developing extremely high frequency sound waves to kill cancer tissue without radiation. Yet the amazing power of sound has remained hidden or out of reach in popular culture. Part of the reason is perhaps that it is hard problem and part of the the reason maybe that simpler cheaper alternatives have filled the vacuum. All this is about to change thanks to the power of the incredibly powerful machines in your hand : the mobile phone.

&quot;The internet of sound&quot; aims to bring sound to the technological revolution it has missed. It aims to give the unexplored power of sound back to people. Universal nature of sound makes it very powerful and offers a unique platform for people and businesses to connect. Sound can be the thread to connect us without the confines of language, sight or network. The Internet of sound can change the very perception of the world around us and we are sitting on the cusp of the revolution.

Trillbit is one of the first Indian Tech startups to get into the Internet of Sound.



**Trillbit: Proximity Intelligence by Sound**

**Mrigesh Parashar** , and **Bhaskar Deo** , were batchmates while they were pursuing M.sc. in Exploration Geophysics in IIT Kharagpur from 2006 to 2011. Both of them being passionate &quot;core&quot; students, they went on to bag jobs in Schlumberger and worked on different projects based on Sound/Acoustic based technology in various countries like US and Egypt for 5 years.

&quot;Our Trillbit journey started when we were were listening a talk show on a car radio&quot;, recalls Bhaskar. He further adds, &quot;The host told to visit a link for more information. Later we could not remember the link. Then we thought it would be great if Legacy devices such as TV and Radio can send information to our smartphone and we can revisit it as per our convenience. We were working in the area of acoustic and sound technology, so we tried to find the solution via sound. While developing the solution, we realized the potential of our technology. There are more number of Audio speakers than people on earth.&quot; They met a batchmate named- **Shashikant Burnwal,** who was a Mechanical engineering graduate from the same batch and MBA graduate from ISB, and had worked for Tata Motors and Ola in Business development.  Together these three set out on a journey to convert each and every speaker into a data transmitter and connect the world through sound!

**The Technology**

Data can be modulated on to any wave. Technologies like WiFi and Bluetooth modulate data on Electromagnetic (EM) waves and need specialized hardware (Receivers and transmitters). Sound is also a wave (though it is mechanical and not EM) and hence can be used for data transfer. However, the technology to modulate the data on the sound wave which can be played over any speaker and received by any microphone is not simple.

Trillbit&#39;s technology essentially transforms any speaker and mic into a data transfer device! They encode a layer of data on top of existing sounds and any device with a speaker turns into a data transmitter. The data layer is inaudible so nothing changes for a person but the smartphone starts sensing and capturing this data. The fact that it does not need any special hardware makes it powerful and universal.

Trillbit&#39;s proprietary technology sends ultrasonic pulses, which they call &quot;Trill&quot; tones, from any speaker. Trill tones are encoded with data which a human ear cannot hear but a smart device can decode. Any smart device with a microphone - be it your mobile, tablet or laptop can catch these tones. It can then, using the app, interpret these tones to trigger specific actions or transmit contextual data. This technology can be used to serve several purposes, e.g. user-authentication, IoT, Payments, Retail, and even underwater robotics.

**Use Cases**

**Television and Radio**

It helps advertisers to interact in real time with TV viewers, radio listeners using the power of data over sound by sending information directly to smart phones without the need of any network by adding inaudible sound waves on top of the broadcast. Thus, enhancing the viewing experience by adding an extra dimension to a live broadcast without causing any interference.

Television and Radio have been the preferred choices for advertisers to expand their footprint in tier III cities and beyond. In a country where even the poorest of the poor people have a set top box installed in their house, it makes sense to pay the big bucks for advertisement on TV. But unlike the popular Google ad-sense and Facebook adverts, indexing the effectiveness of the marketing campaign is a daunting task, moreover there is no communication channel through which a user&#39;s smartphone can be connected to the ad without the use of any additional hardware. Advertisers are putting in a lot of money but these ads make a passive outreach, and people have to put in additional effort to search more about the product. With Trillbit&#39;s SDK and encryption algorithms, advertisers can connect with the smartphone of the user while the ad is playing on the television, thereby giving them the ability to show relevant offers/information/popups.

**Retail Stores**

The second important application of the technology comes into action in the brick and mortar stores that you see in malls, shopping complexes around your city. Almost every store in the mall is equipped with a sound system through which store owners can play music. Trillbit helps shop owners to interact with shoppers in real time and offer them a personalized experience. First it detects their presence with ultrasonic microzoning. And then the technology enables store owners to send important information to people passing around the stores with the help of the speakers and the layer encrypted to the sound coming out of the speaker. In this way they can utilise this existing infrastructure which saves them any initial investment cost, gives similar type of engagement and experience as compared to any other advertising tool.

**Large crowded places**

This technology can also be used in places like stadiums, concerts and airports, where transmitting dynamic information to a large group becomes problematic as WiFi or telecom networks fail due to a large audience. With Trillbit&#39;s technology, information can be broadcasted over sound waves directly to the smart devices even in airplane mode.

**User identification**

Trillbit uses unique inaudible audio tones to exchange the encrypted information. The limited use of wi-fi or mobile network makes it more secure. This process has been developed for all type of devices, The use of speaker and microphone makes this technology universal and truly cross-platform.

**Secure payment**

Trillbit provides a secure, multi-platform and the most diverse solution for transactions and payments. The technology can be effortlessly embedded into your payment system; whether it&#39;s a traditional payments system (e.g. ATMs, POS systems, E-commerce platforms) or an advanced system such as a mobile wallet.

Broadcasts, Retail stores and Live Events are the immediate avenues that the company is currently trying to monetise, but imagine a world where devices can interact with each other through the same medium as us, Sound!                                                                           Although, sound has always been central to our human existence, it has remained as a passive medium in digital advancements and Trillbit aims to bridge this gap. There is no common universal protocol to connect Internet of things (IoT), in connecting missing pieces. The company  can exploit sound&#39;s omnipresence to build an universal ecosystem that can be leveraged by multiple devices across different platforms like Secure payments, User authentication and Smart homes.

**Traction**

&quot;We are currently deploying two types of revenue models. First one is monthly subscription fee model, wherein the customer pays us a fixed cost based on the number of stores where they play our tone. And the second one is the popular pay-per-click model wherein the customer pays on the basis of the number of end users who clicked on the ad after receiving it&quot;, explains Shashikant Burnwal, who leads the Business development for Trillbit.

The startup is currently doing a pilot with Online Payment companies whose apps will be integrated with the SDK of Trillbit&#39;s technology. Shoppers will be able to receive notifications about any offers in the store through the sound systems.

&quot;We acquired few clients and also doing pilots with major retailers and TV channels and soon our solution will be omnipresent in retail and broadcasting industry.&quot;, adds Shashikant.

2018 has been the year of initial business development and technology adoption for the company. They have acquired some clients in India and other geographies. The startup is expecting 2019 to be the year of growth with good business out of TV, Radio and retail platform and have significant presence in markets like India, USA etc. By 2022, Trillbit aims to be the preferable choice for physical businesses and TV/Radio broadcasters for real-time information exchange and be present in various geographies and reach a mark of 50 million dollar annual revenue!
