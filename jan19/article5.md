**Apple: iProblem for the iPhone**

_Samruddhi Pataskar, 3rd year UG, Chemistry, IIT KGP_

_The dwindling sales of iPhone in the Indian market coupled with the extremely poor reception of the newly launched versions have definitely robbed iPhone of its established prodigality. Smartphone research firm Counterpoint Research feels that iPhone&#39;s India sales could drop by as much as 25% very soon. Apple&#39;s market share has eroded from 2.5% in 2017 to just 1% in 2018._

_We ponder over some of the reasons for this._

iPhone has iProblems. Major ones as sales have seen a major slump. CEO Tim Cook reportedly cited the currency weakness in India for this slump - as the currency in India, Turkey, Russia and Brazil weakened, Apple had to raise prices that worked counterintuitively for them.

But we cannot blame it all on just currency weakness. Increased prices and competition, continuous rifts with government regulations and Apple&#39;s confused marketing methods are factors that we just can&#39;t overlook. Let&#39;s look at them in detail:

High Prices

Chinese competitors such as OnePlus, Xiaomi, Samsung and Oppo have won over customers with cheaper prices while making no compromises on specifications. The latest OnePlus may not have better but has comparable specifications and costs less than half  an iPhone XR.

The premium phone segment is still far from becoming mainstream in India but the iPhone XS, XS Max, and XR are all premium phones, with lavish prices close to Rs 1 lakh.

Apple&#39;s affordable phones like iPhone 4 and iPhone SE were popular among Apple loyalists but they too have now have gone off the shelves. The cheapest iPhone available, iPhone 6, will also be phased out in 2019. After this happens, expecting the Apple Loyalists to shift to the premium phone segment just to maintain loyalty will probably be a gross overstatement.

Losing the Design Edge

Steve Jobs was himself a prodigy when it came to design. And it is pretty evident that one of the main reasons that set Apple a class apart has always been the sharpness in design. But Apple is losing this design edge to Chinese and Korean companies that have started imitating Apple&#39;s design, step by step. Be it display and touch sensors, rounded corners or the grid of icons, Apple&#39;s rivals are emulating it and they&#39;re doing a great job at it! In the affordable premium category, Chinese companies have copied the design, including the location of the dual-camera setup, the lineup of the microphone, antenna bands and position of the company&#39;s logo.

Poor Strategy for the Indian Market

When the Indian government wanted to promote local manufacturing, the Chinese players immediately opened manufacturing facilities for phones in India, unlike Apple. This enabled the Chinese competitors to keep their prices at a minimum.

Apple, on the other hand, did not set up manufacturing units in India and imports all iPhones. This adds to the already expensive price, making it even further out of reach!

The solution to this might seems that Apple should bring in foreign direct investment into India and set up local manufacturing units here. But it&#39;s not that simple - Apple might argue that given the small market segment in India for iPhones, why should they even bother to set up local manufacturing units? This is a classic case of the chicken and egg conundrum where low sales lead to no local manufacturing setups that further lead to higher priced iPhones that bring us back to low sales! And low sales do not motivate a company of Apple&#39;s stature to set up manufacturing units.

Apple has set up manufacturing units in China, where they find the sales to be inviting enough for FDI. Although it is worth arguing that the Indian smartphone market should not be compared with that of China because we must keep in mind the fact that China has a very developed smartphone market while the average selling price (ASP) of smartphones in India is still amongst the lowest.

On a different strategic angle that failed, Apple tried to implement a &#39;carrier model&#39; in India as it did in the U.S. The carrier, i.e., the telecom operator pays for the phone and recovers by charging customers for voice and data. But this strategy failed in India because data tariffs are very cheap in India. If charged high, these services will find no customers.

No defined Online Strategy

E-commerce has a well-established network in India by now but Apple believes that taking an aggressive online approach would dilute the brand. Chinese brands are not conservative on this front and hence they gain a lot from flash sales and exclusive deals online. OnePlus believes that they entered the industry at the right time and are in touch with the tech-savvy community in the age group of 16-35.

Apple does not have any fixed online sales strategy. When they needed big sales during festive seasons, they did tie up with e-commerce companies but still, sales were not substantial. For example, during Flipkart&#39;s Big Billion Day sale, Flipkart offered discounts on iPhones but the resellers&#39; online channel could not. Apple does not have a dedicated team to monitor e-commerce over all platforms as well.

But is this plight shared by Apple alone? Or is this an industry-specific issue for the entire smartphone industry?

The smartphone market has become a victim of its own success. Smartphones have reached a mature age, which means that almost anyone and everyone capable of buying a smartphone already owns one. New features also are extremely marginal and are not proving to be good enough incentives for an upgradation. Probably the inclusion of 5G technology might give sales a push. But will 5G technology offer something so strong that can revolutionize the market? That&#39;s another question that cannot be answered with certainty now.

Anyway, let&#39;s take a look at some figures:

After a successful decade, smartphone shipments dropped 3% to 1.42 billion in 2018. Samsung, a long-term leader of smartphone sales, observed shipments drop 8 percent. Apple lost $74.6 billion in market value, its worst loss since 2013.

Surprisingly, Apple has been affected particularly in China, the second largest economy in the world. Owing to the trade war with the US, and cheaper smartphones by homegrown companies like Oppo, Xiaomi, and Huawei, China is expected to cause Apple&#39;s revenues to fall below projections on a global scale!

All said and done, Apple has faced rougher times and has bounced back stronger than before. Yet, the iProblems for the iPhone are something that definitely have become tabloid gossip in the technology and business circles. People are waiting to see how Apple tackles this, and so are we.
