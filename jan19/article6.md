Cryptocurrencies were allegedly started because the public lost trust in banks and other financial institutions as a result of the subprime mortgage crisis in 2007-08. I&#39;m using the term &#39;allegedly&#39; to justify my opinion.  Anyway, we&#39;ll be more interested in what cryptocurrency lacks rather than why it was needed. But still, you can&#39;t answer the former without answering the latter.

Enough talk, let&#39;s now walk the walk.

Although a lot of people claim that cryptocurrencies would change how we do banking and financial transactions, I wish to express my personal thoughts about its current limitations. Of course, technology changes and in the future, the limitations can be addressed easily. This article addresses why banks are afraid of cryptocurrencies, and remind you, they are afraid; otherwise, they would have made a cryptocurrency of their own before most of the people even came to know about it.

The bitcoin whitepaper published by Satoshi Nakamoto (2008) describes bitcoin as:

_A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash that would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution._

As described in the paper, bitcoin does **exactly** the same thing and nothing else.

Definition of a bank as quoted on  [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank):

_A bank is a financial institution that accepts deposits from the public and creates credit. Lending activities can be performed either directly or indirectly through capital markets._

Definitions, though supposed to elucidate in few words, can also end up making things obscure. So let&#39;s take a look at things from a broader perspective:



Banks provide liquidity and credit in capital markets

What &quot;providing liquidity&quot; means is that we can either take money or deposit money whenever needed. &quot;Providing credit&quot; refers to banks lending to individuals and businesses.

The role of banks is to take public money and lend it back to them in need. In return, they give the public interest on the money deposited as an opportunity cost and against inflation. If you have money tied up in bundles like Pablo Escobar, the inflation rate is going to eat up the value of the money.

Commercial banks

[Commercial banks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_bank) mainly offer savings account and fixed deposit for earning interest and current account for businesses to operate where they don&#39;t charge any interest and neither do they charge any fees for that. With the deposits they take, they invest it in debt which people want in the form of mortgage, vehicle loan, and, up to some extent, lend to companies.

Investment banks

[Investment banks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment_banking) help companies raise money through IPO or bond issues. They also have a network of HNIs (High Net-worth individuals) and institutions who want to invest money in order to generate returns. They also act as market makers in exchanges and buy/sell assets when no one is willing to. They help to provide a route for retail investors to invest in public companies and charge brokerage for that.

Well, you would be now thinking that all of this can be done through blockchain technology (not essentially cryptocurrency), right?

If yes, then you might be a blockchain developer. Kudos, but do read the entire thing. I promise that you would learn something from it and it would be fun.

Let&#39;s talk about the origin of money, banking system and others. My ideologies have been influenced by  [&quot;The Ascent of Money: A Financial History of the World&quot;](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2714607-the-ascent-of-money) written by [Niall Ferguson](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5790.Niall_Ferguson).

Elizabethan era

[This period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabethan_era) is regarded as the &quot;golden period&quot; in English history. If you are good in history, you would remember that Shakespeare lived in this era and if you are one of his fans, you might have read the book [&quot;The Merchant in Venice&quot;](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Merchant_of_Venice). Lending in this era was mostly peer-to-peer -  like Shylock gave money to Bassanio while Antonio (his friend and a wealthy person who had his money parked in outside waters) would cover it in case of default.

So, to be historically precise, banking and lending were always done peer-to-peer. But something happened where people realized the need for a bank.

As the story of &quot;A Merchant of Venice&quot; unfolds, a rumour spreads out that Antonio&#39;s ships have been wrecked and thus he has lost most of his investment. This triggers a default of the debt. I hope you see an issue over here.

Antonio was a person with an extremely good credit history but he still defaulted because of something beyond his control. Peer-to-peer lending had failed because it had failed to **diversify in numbers**. What if the ship gets wrecked? Then Shylock would simply lose his entire investment. But had Shylock given his money to a million people, the losses would be minuscule and could be easily covered up with risk premiums in the interest rate.



Federal Reserve of the United States of America

SubpriThe concept of a [Federal Reserve Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Bank) in the United States was borrowed from European countries in the 1900s. What if some people with malicious intent declared that a bank is going bankrupt even though it was actually quite healthy? No bank keeps deposited money in lockers and pays interest on them. Instead, a major portion of the money is invested. In case of such calumny against a bank, all clients will rush to withdraw their money and the bank, being unable to clear its current liabilities, would actually go bankrupt! This is where the existence of the Federal Bank becomes relevant. The Federal Bank becomes the central source of liquidity and it could inject money whenever it wishes and assist the bank to cover up for its short-term liabilities. This is the current solution to the age-old banking problem.

I have presented an extremely simple model and of course, this isn&#39;t quite true. Hold on to your spears, please.

me Mortgage Crisis

This is said to be fueled because of the extremely low-interest rates during the tenure of [Alan GreenSpan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Greenspan) as Chair of the US Federal Reserve since he strongly believed in deregulation and the market being the best decider of the price. To the blockchain folks, what this means is that a common consensus can&#39;t always work. When dealing with humans, we always have to take into account human emotions like fear and greed. Otherwise, we would end up like [Long Term Capital Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-Term_Capital_Management), the hedge fund management firm that collapsed in the 1990s. Smart as they were, they ended up losing money for their investors, forcing the Federal Reserve to drive a bailout arrangement with the concurrence of 16 financial institutions.

There are many more such stories that can be included to prove why a central regulation system is required, but then this already long article would become even longer. The book, &quot;The Ascent of Money&quot;, describes in detail why [Free Markets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_market) failed to solve this issue.

As for the current state, the blockchain industry has no solution in the near term and, in fact, is already showing problems.



Cartels in Cryptocurrency markets

There are already many cartels in the futures market of bitcoin operating via CME which, because of their [leveraged position](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leverage.asp#axzz1gKhHisSM), are manipulating cryptocurrency prices.

Your broker/exchange isn&#39;t decentralized

Many people who buy cryptocurrency from an exchange or broker don&#39;t realize that the transaction they just did while purchasing the asset is, in fact, the same old transaction. One first deposits money in the broker/exchange&#39;s bank account using maybe NEFT/RTGS/UPI or something else. The broker then arranges for the asset to be bought at market price and takes a commission. After the asset is bought, it can be transferred to any entity which is decentralized. Of course, if you have mined the cryptocurrency, then you shouldn&#39;t be worried about this except when you try to sell it in the open market.

The brokers/exchanges are unregulated private companies. Their balance sheets are not publicly available. You might never know when the broker/exchange might go bankrupt. They don&#39;t have to follow rules as other national exchanges do. They don&#39;t invest enough in the security of their platform. They might be using the idle cash in your account to buy cryptocurrency for their account, and guess what, you would never know. How is that bad? Well, if the asset prices go down, the broker/ exchange would make a loss on a trade where they didn&#39;t even have to put a collateral, which could be a serious issue if the broker has  high leverage. White collar crimes like [spoofing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoofing_(finance)) in cryptocurrency exchanges are extremely common. And did I mention about the huge [bid-ask spread](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bid-askspread.asp) they charge? Ouch, 3%-5% of the trade amount would definitely hurt your pockets.

High Volatility

The cryptocurrency markets at this point in time are extremely volatile. Let&#39;s say a merchant sold some goods worth $8000 and, according to the current BTC price, the buyer paid 1 BTC. Now, the merchant has an open position in BTC. He can either go in the market and quickly sell it and pay the broker/exchange fee to carry forward the open position where he runs the risk of the currency being devalued. If the next day, BTC prices drop to $7000, then the merchant incurs a loss of $1000. If you are a [derivatives trader](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/derivative.asp), you could argue that the open position can be hedged using futures and options (one such strategy being gamma scalping), but then think again, should a simple merchant be involved in complex derivatives transactions (and pay a hefty fee for that too)? Probably no, right?

Economic Benefit

Remember, the 51% attack wouldn&#39;t be fruitful because the computing power would just be wasted and bitcoin&#39;s worth will drop subsequently. Well, things just changed thanks to the introduction of bitcoin futures in CME. Now you can have a short position in bitcoin, perform a 51% attack (even easier now because of the consolidation of miners) and gain a huge profit. As of now, bitcoin futures are thinly traded instruments but they are leveraged instruments. Anytime in the future, if the volume of such contracts increases, it will be a good opportunity for investment.

All these issues show that cryptocurrency doesn&#39;t solve the basic problems of financial institutions. It should be just seen as a computer science marvel working on existing problems with our current knowledge of distributed systems. Harsh, but true.
