Technology and India’s Defence

(Astha Jakher, 2nd year student, HSS)

“The Indian Army is the third largest army in the world in terms of the sheer number of personnel. But are we technologically as adept as others? It’s a question we innocuously ponder over. We can only assimilate the facts on India’s and other countries’ defence technology. With the recent tension in the air, this is something that all Indians interested in technology should be aware of.” 

Struggles on border

On 14 February 2019, a convoy of vehicles carrying security personnel on the Jammu Srinagar National Highway was attacked by a vehicle-borne suicide bomber at Lethpora (near Awantipora) in the Pulwama district, Jammu and Kashmir, India. Forty CRPF personnel died on spot.

On 10 February 2018, at pre-dawn, Jaish-e-Mohammed fidayeen attacked an Indian Army camp in Sunjuwan, Jammu. 11 soldiers, 4 attackers and 1 civilians were killed and 20 injured including 14 soldiers, five women, and a child.

On 2 January 2016, an attack was launched on Pathankot Air Force Station, part of the Western Air Command of the Indian Air Force by terrorist organizations based in a neighboring country. Four attackers and two security forces personnel were killed in the initial battle and after 17 hours of ceasefire violations, the toll raised to 6.

The necessity of defence research

While a population of crores locks down their doors at night, Indian Army has always stood guarding the open borders and vindictive regions in Kashmir. The weather conditions and the unfamiliar terrains around these areas have also raised the death toll of soldiers who make a choice of leaving behind comfortable lifestyles. The temperatures in the areas where forces are deployed go less than -4 degree centigrade. ‘The Wire’ specifically talks about how the weaponry used is often old and outdated. The Indian Army is the third largest army in the world in terms of the sheer number of personnel. According to the ‘Observer Research Foundation’, this description obfuscates the fact that it is not as powerful as one of the world’s largest armies. Its capacity to undertake military operations optimally in the multi-domain, technology-dominated battlefield of the future is questionable. The Indian Army essentially remains a force largely organized, equipped and trained to fight wars of the past. Having said that, it is not as if the Army cannot carry out its role and tasks successfully if it is provided the requisite means to do so. And so, it seems almost imperative that the Army be modernized expeditiously if it has to be prepared to take on the security challenges of the future.

A technological study of other armies

China has increased its activity in the Tibet Autonomous Region and near Doklam tri-junction. They’ve been heavily investing in modernization of army and retouching the technology invested on their weapons and war strategies. The surveillance techniques have shown considerable improvement and the rapid implementation of AI models in defence areas that have set them a foot ahead of us. 

US Army is actively working on creating robots that will be capable of dismantling the rocket bombs. They also envision a kind of portable nuclear reactor that could move with units and provide all the power needs for a remote military base, eliminating the need to transport lots of fuel and maintain long supply lines to keep a base fueled up.

The Russian Army designed Poseidon to bypass American missile defenses and blow up coastal targets. The company responsible for making small arms for them is now making drones that crash into their targets and explode.

Despite being in a geographically and politically challenging position, the Israeli Army has relied on the foundations of flat hierarchy and innovation to counter their challenges. Software by BioCatch - an Israeli company that’s in collaboration with the Israeli Army - checks more than 500 bio-behavioral, cognitive and physiological parameters to create unique user profiles for visitors of banking and eCommerce sites, distinguishing between regular users and criminal users.

Pakistan, though technologically behind us, has seen rapid rise in militant groups which puts us at the threat of further attacks.

The best time is now.

India’s defence research status

DRDO has recently carried out a successful test for ‘Rustom 2’, which was being developed on the lines of predator drones of the US to carry out surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) roles for the armed forces with an endurance of 24 hours. Rustom 2 is capable of carrying different combinations of payloads like synthetic aperture radar, electronic intelligence systems, and situational awareness payload. This is marked as significant progress on the grounds that we’ve heavily depended on imports till now for the drones.

The Indian Navy has inaugurated the Integrated Automatic Aviation Meteorological System (IAAMS) at INS Garuda and INS Parundu. IAAMS is working on the modernization of meteorological infrastructure of 9 Naval Air Stations (NAS) by bringing accuracy in the weather monitoring mechanism of the Indian Navy. This means that the accidents and mishaps in navigation that are faced by our Navy would go down significantly.

Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd has also contributed significantly to defence research since 1964. It follows DRDO in the level of contribution dedicated to defence research. Recently, it has successfully flown the home-made 5.8-tonne Light Combat Helicopter with its own automatic flight control system for the first time. This helicopter can be an important asset to IAF, once its production is scaled up after solving some current issues.

Alpha Design Technologies Ltd. has signed a ₹45-crore deal with the Ministry of Defence to supply the Army with indigenous simulators for gunnery and missile firing from BMP II vehicles. The Navy’s third state-of-the-art Scorpene class submarine, INS Karanj, was also launched in Mumbai recently.

Another key move post the Doklam crisis was the setting up of an institutional mechanism called the Defence Planning Committee (DPC) under the chairmanship of National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and having the Foreign Secretary, the Chairman of chiefs of staff committee and chiefs of the Army, Navy and the Air Force as its members. The DPC has been tasked to make an "action plan" to effectively deal with various security challenges facing the nation and prepare drafts of national security strategy and doctrines.

Considering the rising turbulence in the Indian Ocean, the second Offshore Patrol Vessel (OPV) was built by the Larsen and Toubro Shipyard near Chennai recently. This will be deployed by the Indian Naval Forces. A Survey Training Vessel is also being procured to augment the Navy’s growing hydrographic needs in ports, harbors, and exclusive economic zones. Indian Navy has been undertaking the hydrographic survey for a number of friendly nations in the Indian Ocean and beyond.

The Defence Ministry has recently given the final approval for the procurement of 131 Barak missiles for the Navy and 240 precision-guided munitions (PGM) for the Indian Air Force (IAF), estimated together at ₹1,714 crore. The precision-guided weapon is called KAB-1500, which is a laser-guided bomb and is for use on IAF’s Sukhoi Su-30MKI fighter jets. It is designed to destroy ground targets such as railway lines, ammunition depots, bridges, military facilities, and ships. The bomb’s warhead weighs 1100 kilograms. The bomb has folding fins that allow it to maneuver while being guided to the target. 131 Barak Missiles are surface-to-air missiles that are designed to be used as a shipborne anti-missile defence system. Most of the Navy’s ships will be equipped with the missile system.

Low-Intensity Conflict Electronic Warfare System is being procured from M/s Bharat Electronics Limited for Rs 470 crore. This system will equip the Indian Army with upgraded communications infrastructure to effectively deal with advanced communications systems being used by terrorist groups.

Efforts are being made to improve the training sessions of personnel and this has inspired several efforts from authorities. The P-8I Training Solution accurately simulates P-8I aircraft and mission systems. It will help Indian Navy train and realistically rehearse for sophisticated missions involving the P-8I aircraft, all at a fraction of the cost of live aircraft training.

And finally, BMP-2 is being procured for Indian army’s mechanized infantry and other arms and services at an estimated cost of ₹1125 crore from the Ordnance Factory Board (OFB).

The issues of defence imports

Technological Advancements in Indian Army are listed on the bucket-list of every government. However, in most situations, the immediate impulse of our authorities is to import the ready-made weaponry and combat instruments rather than actively engaging in technology exchange and prioritizing research in defence. A stark example of this was the controversy over the Rafale Deal. The step was needed to upgrade India's aging fleet. The original plan was that India would buy 18 off-the-shelf jets from France's Dassault Aviation, with 108 others being assembled in India by the state-run Hindustan Aeronautics Limited or HAL in Bangalore. Faced with the dipping number of fighters and a pressing need to upgrade the Indian Air Force, Prime Minister Narendra Modi intervened and decided to buy 36 "ready-to-fly" fighters instead of trying to acquire technology from Dassault and make it in India. The twin-engine Rafale combat jet is designed from the beginning as a multi-role fighter for an air-to-air and air-to-ground attack. It is nuclear-capable and its onboard Electronic Warfare (EW) systems can also perform reconnaissance and radar jamming roles. At a point where rather than having the techniques to build these instruments in future, we’re becoming mere consumers of defense goods, it becomes imperative to not neglect this sphere of advancements. Though the government has emphasized private firms and public-private partnerships, the Indian defence industry continues to be dominated by the public sector. The Defence Ministry stumbles over promoting the private sector, which is still restricted to only 26% in the defence production sector. This is definitely a sector where “Make in India” can really make a difference.
