“The 22nd Governor of Reserve Bank of India (2008-2013), Dr. Subbarao, completed his B.Sc in Physics from IIT Kharagpur and M.Sc in Physics from IIT Kanpur. He topped the Civil Services Examination in 1972, becoming one of the first IITians to do so! He also holds an Economics Master’s Degree from Ohio State University and was awarded the Humphrey Fellowship at MIT. As the Governor of RBI, Dr. Subbarao was extremely crucial in guiding India through the 2008 Global Financial Crisis. He has also published a book in 2016 - “Who Moved My Interest Rate?: Leading the Reserve Bank of India Through Five Turbulent Years”.

  
  

The 16th Annual Alumni Meet at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur. The atmosphere is a big dose of nostalgia with a pinch of curiosity for the alumni. “Does Cheddis still exist?” asks the lean gentleman from the ‘79 batch, who also happens to be the CTO of a multi-national firm. He smiles in reminiscence of the 3 AM memories he’s had in that place. “These lanes weren’t there during our times”, remarks an alumna from the ‘94 batch staring down the complete stretch of The Scholars’ Avenue as if in search of her college self. In more hushed corners of the Technology Guest House, the Tech Ambit team waits excitedly for the man of the hour - Dr. Duvvuri Subbarao. 

  

The ex-Governor of RBI, a retired IAS Officer, an Indian Economist, and a Central Banker, Dr. Subbarao arrives in a black suit, but his personality embellished more by his aura than by the attire. Not long after greetings and introductions, we found ourselves walking briskly to his room where this interview was to take place. He opens our conversation with words of appreciation for IIT Tech Ambit and sits down with us to chat about technology adoption in RBI, capitalism, happiness, life and future challenges.

  

Following is an edited transcript of the conversation: 

  

IIT Tech Ambit: How does the advent of technology and research effect, either directly or indirectly, the policy-making at RBI?

  

Dr. Subbarao: There’s practically no human endeavor that is not influenced by technology. Everything that the RBI does is certainly influenced by research and technology. In order to do what it does - that is policy-making in the real world - RBI has to understand the sociological and economic dynamics that are evolving in societies, communities, families, and individuals. Monetary policy, management of the external sector, financial inclusion, payment systems are all influenced by technology. Today, due to the Aadhar technology integrated with smartphones you can transfer money from one phone to another just by a virtual account. This puts India way ahead of other countries in terms of financial inclusion and a lot of this is primarily due to technological advancements.  

  

IIT Tech Ambit: Do you think that over the last few centuries, capitalism and technology have become quite inseparable? How can we shape a better future knowing that research and technology are oriented towards money mindedness?

  

Dr. Subbarao: I’m not sure that a question like this is amenable for a binary answer. If you look at technology in the larger sense, I could certainly say that innovation is the driving force of human civilization. Capitalism is, after all, the pursuit of self-interest which contributes to collective societal welfare and innovation is certainly a motivator. As Adam Smith said, “It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest.” Capitalism has been a very positive force.

Although one may argue that recent developments in technology - the digital revolution, the third wave or whatever you wish to call it - has created a ‘winner takes all’ atmosphere or ‘The Network Effect’ whereby inequalities have widened all over the world. Even in India, technology is not the actual culprit. It’s got more to do with ‘how’ we handle technology. So, I don't think we should throw the baby out with the bathwater.

  

IIT Tech Ambit:  A recent trend that has become noticeable is that research in natural sciences like physics, chemistry etc has become less appealing to students. They are generally drawn towards more financially rewarding fields like machine learning, robotics, artificial intelligence etc. What kind of impact do you think this trend will bear?

  

Dr. Subbarao: I must say that I was not aware that research in more frontier fields like artificial intelligence and machine learning is edging out interests in more fundamental sciences. I certainly believe that science and technology have to go hand in hand. You need to do fundamental research in basic sciences in order to drive technology and those technological developments have to show avenues where science can focus. I find the current trend, if true, to be regressive and disappointing. However, some correction will automatically take place and opportunities will open up there too, because there is an equilibrium that has to be maintained for progress.

  

IIT Tech Ambit: Do you believe that technological advancements today are leading to a happier life and a happier future?

  

Dr. Subbarao: This question is again not amenable to a simple answer. All of the human progress has been driven by an aspiration for happiness. Religions, social orders, family systems are all in some sense a pursuit of happiness but its always been an elusive goal. Technology has certainly improved convenience in day-to-day life, has eliminated lots of diseases, increased the longevity of life but still, a lot of people are unhappy. There is no correlation between wealth, capital income and mental happiness. 

  

We have a very compartmentalized view of what technology is, depending on where we are coming from, our experiences and exposure. If you are coming from a hospital, you would think of technology in terms of healing whereas if you come from a computer laboratory you would think of technology as hardware capabilities to supplement AI. 

  

IIT Tech Ambit: What message do you have for today’s young technocrats? 

  

Dr Subbarao: I have come across some debate recently, about what should be the goal of a company or a corporate structure. If you go to an economics class or a finance class they tell you that the goal is to make money for the shareholders. Milton Friedman, the winner of 1976 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, the leading economist of the 20th century said that any corporation that is concentrating on any objective other than making profits is wasting its time. Everything else is taken care of by other people. But today we believe that it is misguiding for our times and that companies and entrepreneurs should be looking at goals beyond their immediate money-making motto. They should be thinking about what contribution they are making to the society and that should be the guiding spirit especially for those coming from our premier institutions like IITs. 

  

My only advice is that you should focus on problems that have a more immediate impact on society. Be demand driven rather than supply driven. Identify problems prevailing in the country and apply solutions that are appropriate for our economic structure and our way of living. For instance, in this ‘Industrial revolution 4.0’ there are people who claim that machine learning, robotics, and artificial learning are going to take away jobs from people as it is replacing our mental abilities. It should be your goal to manage this challenge and prove them wrong.

  

IIT Technology Ambit heartily thanks Dr. Subbarao for his time and kind encouragement. We sincerely hope that his ideologies can come of help to the readers and society as a whole.
