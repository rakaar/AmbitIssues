It was found by Mr. Ray Sikka, an alumnus of IIT Kharagpur, who currently serves as the CEO of the company as well. We look in detail  at some interesting real-world applications of IOT that Sensitel has harnessed.”

We have surely entered the new age of technology in the 21st century where advancements in services are going up and beyond. With high advancements in computing power and new generation tools of machine learning and artificial intelligence, a lot of companies are able to harness the potential of data on a magnificent level impacting everyone’s life on a daily basis.

One of such companies that has mastered data processing and analysis is Sensitel. The point of leveraging the Internet of Things (IoT) and big data technologies is ultimately to make better decisions and deliver delightful user experiences. Sensitel, an applications and data analytics company based in Santa Clara, California, helps companies do just that.

By collecting data from tiny embedded sensors, the kind found in everything from smartphones to GPS devices, Sensitel's solutions allow companies to garner insights into parts of their business that they rarely could before. Logistics service providers, for instance, have used Sensitel's TrackAware solution to track over 1,000,000 shipments and ensure on-time delivery.

Trackaware: “Tracking every move to ensure on-time delivery”

One of Sensitel’s most impactful products is ‘TrackAware’. TrackAware is a cloud-based tracking solution that provides end to end solution for transportation and shipments. TrackAware's unique shipment arrival time tracking algorithms accurately predict arrival times for shipments.Facial recognition technology is used to enhance security and authentication of delivery of high-value goods.

Traditionally logistics, maintenance and monitoring of shipments on a larger scale is nothing less than a nightmare. Tracking a delivery required sorting through piles of paperwork between back office dispatchers, drivers, and receiving customers. Engineers waiting to receive their packages had to call up the dispatch looking for expected arrival times on their parts. This manual paper-based tracking led to inefficiencies and errors and was unsustainable with a growing business. Client’s volumes grew 10 times from a few thousand packages a day to tens of thousands of packages across 10+ sites being delivered daily. 

Business users set up a monthly review process leveraging key performance metrics from TrackAware. This led to increased customer satisfaction, improvement in SLA from 70% to 98% on-time delivery, improved scheduling of drivers, reduced driver turnover, and improved safety. Delivery operations are now more predictable and reliable without increased costs. There was a 50% reduction in the number of inquiries (email, phone, etc.) on the status of shipments. TrackAware tangible benefits include fast time to value, real-time visibility into issues while delivering packages, Webbased proof of delivery, and reduced time for pickup and delivery.

TrackAware’s use in the Logistics sector: A case study

Since 1983, RK Group, USA has evolved from its roots as RK Distribution Services, supporting the manufacturing line of leading companies such as IBM, Fujitsu, KLA-Tencor, and Lam Research to become RK Group, on a mission to become the first choice logistics partner of Silicon Valley manufacturers. The company provides warehousing and transportation services for local delivery of high-value parts and equipment. To keep track of product movement, drivers manually wrote down the order and container number for each package being delivered. Sheets of paper collected during the day were submitted to the back-office dispatcher at the end of each shift.

RK Group was looking for a cloud-based solution that could scale with this business growth.

RK Group selected Sensitel TrackAware to mobilize its delivery operations and streamline delivery tracking. Sensitel gathered requirements upfront from all stakeholders and designed an integrated process and solution for time tracking of deliveries. Web-based package tracking with TrackAware was implemented in under four weeks. Drivers were operational with the system within a short one-hour training session. The TrackAware solution generates insights for continual performance improvement with packages reaching their destination faster and optimizing staffing levels of drivers. Current plans are to link pickup schedule with the release of orders in the warehouse. RK group is now considering standardizing this solution across all facilities and multiple customers.
