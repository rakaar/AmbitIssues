ITILITE: A SaaS platform to manage business travel

-Shail Daswani, 3rd year UG, AGFE, IIT KGP

“Solving the corporate travel issues faced by both companies and their employees, ITILITE was founded in 2017 by Mayank Kukreja, an alumnus of IIT Delhi and IIM Ahmedabad, and Anish Khadiya, an IIT Kharagpur and IIM Lucknow alumnus. The Bengaluru-based B2B SaaS travel startup has raised $4.2 Mn (INR 30 Cr) in a Series A round of funding led by Matrix Partners and others. Existing investor, Ashish Gupta, founder of Helion VC, also participated in the round.”

IITs and the Startup Culture

Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) were globally ranked fourth for educating students who went on to create billion-dollar startups, says a report by Sage, a U.K-based accounting software firm. 12 out of 189 founders of billion-dollar startups, known as unicorns, went to one of India’s 23 IITs.

 

India, as a country is standing at the forefront of a technological revolution, and these tech startups are at the epicenter of this revolution. The growth of the startup scene should go as far as 2,000+ new startups created each year by 2020, and job creation from these entrepreneurs go from 65-75k as of today to 250-300k by 2020.

 

The impact of such an effective system can be clearly observed by looking at the hiring statistics. IITs recently ended the first phase of the final placements (2018-19) on a high note, with more than 3000 jobs being offered in the first three days, apart from recording a 10-15 percent rise in the average CTC (Cost to Company) being offered.

The issues in corporate travel:

The techniques of managing businesses are changing drastically. According to a recently concluded survey, most of the startups believe that business travel is a factor in their company’s growth and that they’d almost always prefer to close important deals in person, even if it meant they had to travel to do so. Executives feel that video and phone calls are often poor replacements for more impactful in-person connections.

Apart from getting crucial feedback and in-person connections, business travel is also an important parameter for retaining employees. It helps the employers to make sure that millennials are putting in the energy and passion required in their respective jobs. N[early 40% of Millenials](https://www.theladders.com/career-advice/this-is-how-millennials-really-feel-about-business-travel) now say they categorically wouldn’t take a job that didn’t allow them to travel. 

 

With the number of startups at an all time high, and increased VC funding, we’ve observed aggressive hiring over the last few years leading to swelling burn rates. Add to that the cost of business travel, it becomes very difficult for early stage startups to survive if their employees burn money in their business trips. 

This is where the Corporate Travel Management industry steps in, but the traditional model has narrowed its goal on cutting costs at the expense of traveler satisfaction, transforming the business trip from an exciting time into a dreaded source of employee frustration and a top cause of tension with management.

The Business Travel Market size is expected to reach $1.7 trillion by 2023, registering a CAGR of 4.1% from the current $1.3 trillion valuation. Substantial development of the travel & tourism sector has fostered the demand for business travel. Client meetings, brand & product promotions, business expansion, employee training, and incentives are some of the activities involved in business travel. Frequent corporate domestic and international trips have supplemented the corporate travel market growth. All this said and done, it cannot be denied that helping save companies cut corporate travel costs can easily be morphed into a business model for another company!

In the following sections, we talk about a startup founded by 2 IIT alumni that implements a unique model of incentivization and AI-powered algorithms, to reduce corporate travel cost for companies while making booking experience seamless and transparent.

ITILITE: The SaaS based end-to-end travel management platform

Employees often see a significant experience gap between the consumer travel arrangements that they make on personal travel and their companies’ legacy travel solutions. Because of this, more and more employees get frustrated and try to book outside of the company’s policy and tools while booking business travel. This is leading to travel spend that’s exceedingly difficult for companies to accurately monitor and manage.

Through a model that incentivizes employees for saving on their travel expense, ITILITE helps to bring down the overall travel cost for companies. Its AI-powered algorithms also help control costs by predicting the expense for every trip.

Most of the travelers are estimated to spend over an hour on booking a trip. By the time an employee has searched, applied all the filters he/she needs, and cross-checked prices on consumer sites, he/she has wasted too much time booking a trip instead of excelling at the role they were hired for. The actions need to be quick and the UI must be flawless so that the total time is significantly reduced. ITILITE has done exactly the same and has been able to reduce the total time to around 90 seconds!

ITILITE was founded by Mayank Kukreja, an alumnus of IIT Delhi and IIM Ahmedabad, and Anish Khadiya, an IIT Kharagpur and IIM Lucknow graduate, in 2017. 

“Cost, Convenience and Control, these are the three golden value propositions of our product ”, said Mayank over a phone call. He added, “Cost, by incentivizing the employees to save money for the company. Second is Convenience, by personalizing the entire cycle, the overall process becomes much faster. The third one is Control, which means that even though the system is operated by the employee, the policies are already set in such a manner that the trip lies inside the travel policy of the company and all the data is recorded instantaneously”. 

Personalization

Through its intelligent platform, ITILITE learns employee preferences and delivers personalized recommendations to the employee. This is like having a smart travel assistant capable of instant response. When you surf any B2C travel site, it only knows who you are. It can give you travel recommendations based on your previous visits to the place. But in a B2B setting, let’s suppose that an employee is visiting Mumbai for the first time, ITILITE’s platform will already have information about the hotel preferences of previous employees of the company who have visited Mumbai, which has already been segregated on the basis of the Employee designation, etc. Thereby giving a final list of only 3 personalized options, and 90% of the people choose from among these 3 given options. The second layer of personalisation lies in the use of Artificial Intelligence that can understand the behavior of employees across different categories and predict the changes in the subsequent stays. This layer is yet to be developed, as per Mayank. 

Core Automation

In the corporate world, a complicated international flight trip may involve a layover in tens of countries. Booking such an itinerary involves - contacting at least 200 airlines, figuring out appropriate timings and lowest costs, most efficient payment gateways to use, and since travel aggregation is a low cost industry, the platform also needs to choose the option which generates maximum margin. Large amount of data in real time, in short, has to be processed and analyzed. ITILITE’s team has achieved 20% of the above automation and is on the lookout of engineers across levels who can build such a complex infrastructure.  

Policy Engine

Costs can shift dramatically depending on the time and location of travel, so implementing a flexible and intelligent travel policy is key for reducing travel costs.

For example, let’s say your travel budget for an employee is normally capped at INR 10,000. A Mumbai-Pune trip will definitely cost less than the capped limit, but under normal legacy travel solutions, the employee will try to utilize the entire amount that has been allotted. On the other hand, let’s consider a Mumbai-Kolkata trip, which will definitely cost more than INR 10,000. The employee either has to enter a painful approval process and play the waiting game or get flagged for spending above allowance.

That’s exactly how the Policy Engine of ITILITE works to save companies money while allowing employees to select travel that appeals to their preferences. Leveraging machine learning and advanced algorithms, the price policy is automatically calculated based on real-time market data for that specific trip. That way, the company will save when prices drop and the employees are saved from a major headache.

Revenue and Traction

The company now has around 70 corporate customers, and it predominantly targets enterprises that have an employee strength of 300+ and an annual spend of INR 10 Lakh+ on business travel. A major chunk of ITILITE’s revenue comes from SaaS subscription, and it also generates significant revenue through commissions from hospitality and airline companies. 

The corporate travel market is predominantly dominated by 4 major players, 2 of which are based out of USA. The USA counterparts have raised more than $400 Mn in funding over the years, which clearly shows the potential of this space. 

AI algorithms work to learn individual travelers’ preferences, such as whether they would rather fly in the morning or at night, and if they’d rather stay in a packed conference hotel or a nearby resort down the road.

The end result is similar to how Netflix shows users the options its systems think would appeal to them. Overall, ITILITE with its freshly secured Series A funding of INR 30 Cr is ready to climb the ladders of the corporate travel market in India!
